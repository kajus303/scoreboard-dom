## Test Scenario 4: Local Storage Persistence

### Description

This test ensures that the application correctly stores the scores and the current time in local storage so that data persists across page reloads.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the scoreboard application in a web browser.
2. Increment the score for both Team A and Team B.
3. Refresh the browser page.
4. Verify that the scores for both teams persist and are correctly displayed after the refresh.
5. Allow the timer to count down for a few seconds, then refresh the browser.
6. Verify that the remaining time is correctly displayed after the refresh.

### Expected Outcome

- The scores for both teams should persist in local storage and be displayed correctly after a page refresh.
- The remaining time on the timer should persist and be displayed correctly after a page refresh.

### Actual Results
