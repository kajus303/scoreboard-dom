2. Click the "+1" button under the score display for Team A.
3. Observe the updated score for Team A.
4. Refresh the browser.
5. Check if the score for Team A persists after the refresh.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for Team B using the "+2" and "+3" buttons.

### Expected Outcome

- The updated score should persist after refreshing the browser.
